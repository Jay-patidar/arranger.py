# arranger.py
an python script that will arrange all the files and folders in a particular path in their respective category folder,

as you will run the script it will ask a path as an input. 

note - you must enter the full path e.g C:/users/asus/downloads

the script will scan all the files and folders in the given path, and create 6 folders i.e. audio,video,image,document,setup,others

all the mp4,m4a etc files will be moved to audio folder

same with all other.

all the files which are not mention will be moved to others foler (including existing folders in path)
